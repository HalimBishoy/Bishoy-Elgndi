# The tentative stages of the project:
1. Raw data (link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv).
2. Data Preprocessing.
3. Cross-Validation (Training dataset 70% and Testing dataset 30%).
4. Applying machine learning models (Random Forest - Naive Bayes - Decision Tree - Logistic Regression - K-Nearest Neighbour).
5. Performance Evaluation (Determibe: Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy Prediction).

#  The content of the repository:
1. Reading dataset file.
2. Checking the dimensions of the dataset.
3. Checking the data types for all attributes in the dataset.
4. Checking the missing values for all attributes of the dataset.
5. The summary of the dataset (mean- min- max- Standard deviation) for each attribute.
6. Checking the scores of the response variable.
7. Checking how many unique value does the target variabble 'quality' has.
8. Plotting the frequency distribution of the wine quality using Bar chart.
9. Plotting the frequency distribution of wine quality using Pie chart.
10. The correlation between the target variables.
11. Sorting the correlation values for all attributes with quality in ascending order. 
12. Checking the correleation between all variables using Seaborn's pairplot.
13. Histograms plots for all attributes.
14. Plotting the boxplots for each column against the target variable (Quality) to check the Outliers.
15. Creating a new categorical response variable ('Rating') from the existing 'quality' variable. 
16. Plotting the boxplots for each attribute against the target variable (Rating) to check the Outliers.
17. Dropping the quality column.
18. checking the distribution of the dataset among the Rating values.
19. Plotting the frequency distribution of wine Rating by using the Rating attribute.
20. Removing the outliers.
21. Split The independent variable X, and the reponse variable y.
22. Standardization.
23. Splitting the dataset to training and testing sets.
24. Applying Machine learning model (Logistic Regression Model) (Determine : Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, F1-Score)
